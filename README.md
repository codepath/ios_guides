# CodePath iOS Guides

Welcome to the open-source [CodePath](http://thecodepath.com) iOS Guides. Our goal is to become the **central crowdsourced resource** for complete and up-to-date iOS content and tutorials. [Just take me to the notes](https://github.com/thecodepath/ios_guides/wiki)!

## Motivation

Ever been **frustrated finding information on outdated one-off blog posts and tutorials** that has since become irrelevant? How many times were you googling only to find your answer only on a **2 year old StackOverflow post**? We believe there's got to be a better way. Why not have the community work together to create useful and detailed documentation for every aspect of iOS (or any platform)? There's absolutely no reason that we should have to make do with outdated, vague or un-editable content anymore.
